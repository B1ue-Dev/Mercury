# discord-modmail
This is a fork of the original single Modmail BOT file from https://github.com/terabyte3/Mercury-Modmail-Discord

The following file was provided by [terabyte3](https://github.com/terabyte3). My purpose is to use it as and rewrite the file as a cog if anyone want to use the function for part of cogs in their BOT.

# Usage
- Make sure you have discord.py installed on your system (you probably have it, since using cogs is the next stage of making Discord Bot)
- Put the ID number of your modmail channel in ``data.py``.
- This thing is meant to used for only one channel, so it will not work on multi servers.
